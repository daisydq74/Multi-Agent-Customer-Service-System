I learned how the project’s lightweight FastAPI services and MCP server fit together, including why the MCP server needs to boot first so the data agent can start serving tool calls immediately. It was helpful to map the request path from the router through the data agent, and then over to the support or billing agent, because it clarified how each microservice owns a narrow responsibility.

I also learned how approachable the demo is for experimentation: a single `python demo.py` brings everything up, shows the JSON-RPC chatter in the console, and makes it easy to drop in new prompts or reseed the SQLite database. That simplicity should make it straightforward for others to tinker with customer scenarios and see how the agents collaborate in real time.
